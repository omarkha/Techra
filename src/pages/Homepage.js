                Are you already worried about working with entry level or junior

                <br />
                What your product does for your customers is why they pay you
                money. So with poor quality products you can be losing lots of
                money, losing to your competitors and losing repeat business.
                <br />
                <br /> When you work with such companies, you rarely get the
                product that fits your business needs.

                <br /> Maybe they deliver the product but after a while you find
                that they intentionally put a few bugs in it. That way they can
                take more money from you to fix the bugs they created. What can
