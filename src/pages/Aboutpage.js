              <p className="subhead">
                Hi There, and thanks for your interest.
                <br />
                <br /> I’m Omar Khalil, the CEO of Techra Software Solutions.
                <br />
                <br />
                When I was an 8 year old child, my mother used to bring me and
                my brother to Internet Cafes in the country of Jordan. There she
                communicated with her friends in America.
                <br />
                <br />
                Ever since then I was hooked on how websites were built. I
                didn’t know how they were made, but I was determined to find
                out. So I would try to make websites with Word documents and I
                had some pretty good attempts.
                <br />
                <br />
                Then we arrived in the US in 2009, I was 12 years old at the
                time. I finished Middle School and began High School.
                <br />
                <br />
                At ninth grade I started to take my interest in Software
                Engineering more seriously. So I started learning HTML,
                JavaScript, and CSS. I started to be able to make web
                applications. It was a great feeling and a boost of confidence
                for me in the new country I was living in.
                <br />
                <br />
                After learning web development, I took interest in how desktop
                software was made. I didn’t know what GUIs were, but I knew
                there was a programming language called Java that I could use to
                make Graphical User Interfaces which are basically desktop
                programs. I searched YouTube to find a channel called
                ‘thenewboston’ and I would like to thank Bucky, the owner, for
                his fantastic way of teaching.
                <br />
                <br />
                By learning Java, I made multiple applications. Such as a GUI
                (Desktop Application) that assessed the performance of soccer
                players during soccer matches. The purpose of the app was to
                show players how they did, their progress from game to game, and
                to motivate them to improve their quality.
                <br />
                <br />
                I started to become a Software Engineer. I also took classes in
                Computer Science and Graphics Design in high school. And in the
                year 2022 I completed General Assembly’s Software Engineering
                Bootcamp.
                <br />
                <br />
                I met many cool like-minded people there, and I started to
                network with many other developers on Linkedin. I met many
                talented and experienced software engineers who I worked with
                and they taught me many things.
                <br />
                <br />
                As an extroverted person, networking is a delightful experience
                for me and I built a big network of professionals from various
                backgrounds and professions.
                <br />
                <br />
                I guess I have an entrepreneurial spirit. I went to college for
                entrepreneurship after high school but I decided to drop out.
                The reason being was that I heard many people say that a degree
                in entrepreneurship is basically useless. To be an entrepreneur
                you don’t need to go to college. Most successful entrepreneurs
                are self-taught and self-made.
                <br />
                <br />
                With an entrepreneurial spirit, a passion for Software
                Engineering and a great network, I decided to launch Techra.
